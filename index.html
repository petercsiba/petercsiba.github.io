                I‚Äôve been programming since Internet reached our little village in Eastern Europe.
                During school I become that pure math programmer archetype who preferred watching his feet over others eyes ü§∑
                Lucked out many times - and I thank many folks. My parents, brother, teachers and many peers<br />

                My career in Big World^TM career began at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, where I worked on web search infrastructure, optimizing performance and cost.

                Next, I kept with FinTech at ex-Robinhood founded <a href="https://www.parafin.com/">Parafin</a>, where I led the migration of our complex communications infrastructure. <br />
                Also improved loan servicing logic, and payment systems ‚úâÔ∏èüí∏.

                Most recently, I started exploring how is it to build systems end-to-end from ground-up. Now it is the time - as so many tools to make it easy! Right? üß†
                Well, first we attempted to build an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/voxana-ai/">AI voice-note</a> product with <a href="https://katkasabo.com/">Katka Sabo</a>.
